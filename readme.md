# jupyter-bootstrap

aka IPython Notebook Data Science Bootstrap Boilerplate Project Skeleton

Austin G. Davis-Richardson

A project skeleton for data analysis projects using bootstrap. Includes
boilerplate for writing external modules and testing.

## Motivation

I like ~~IPython~~ Jupyter notebook for interactive computing/data analysis but
I find it difficult to write maintainable code. This is an effort to promote
writing re-usable code as seperate Python modules, with a decent testing
framework in place, and also verify that notebooks build without error (I guess
this is a form of integration testing).

## testing

`nosetests --with-doctests`

## building notebooks

(TODO)
